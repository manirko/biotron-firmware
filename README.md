## Developer quick start

The current review branch targets **1.10.11 (internal candidate)**. See
[`CLEAN-FIRMWARE.md`](CLEAN-FIRMWARE.md) for its exact scope and retained fixes.
It fixes calibration Note Off after a channel change. The frozen 1.10.10
artifact remains unchanged; this candidate requires its own hardware acceptance.

Maintainers should start with [`DEVELOPING.md`](DEVELOPING.md). It explains the runtime ownership model,
compatibility rules, commit stack, exact build identity, test map and the
boundary between firmware, Windows/DAW, offline Settings and Help. The current
Sergey test uses Ableton, not the historical REAPER task.
The optional A06-A08 note-and-beat light experiment is documented separately in
[`LED-MUSIC-PULSE.md`](LED-MUSIC-PULSE.md). It is ON for this A06–A08/Fibonacci
clean candidate; see `CLEAN-FIRMWARE.md` for the exact scope.

```bash
./tests/run_host_tests.sh
```

`cf264aa` is the historical `1.8.3` compatibility candidate; `7471707` is
historical `1.9.8 beta-08`, `303aafc` is the 1.10.9 cleanup, and `2ae1973`
is the frozen 1.10.10 source. Record the new source SHA and 1.10.11 UF2 hash
with every build. Documentation HEAD is not an artifact identity.
A customer release/version requires separate
acceptance; no future `2.0.0` release is authorized by this README.
CI runs the host suite and the pinned Pico SDK build on every push and pull
request (`.github/workflows/pull_request_ci.yml`). It verifies the actual
compiler definitions for version 1.10.11, settings identity and LED flag,
then archives compiler commands, cache, toolchain and artifact hashes.
Ubuntu CI artifacts are separate from the macOS delivery build. Passing
host tests or CI does not itself authorize a merge or release.

## About The Project

### Biotron: A Plant-Responsive MIDI Device

Biotron is a unique MIDI device that transforms the internal processes of plants into musical compositions. By connecting to a plant via electrodes, Biotron captures the plant's natural electrical resistance and translates it into MIDI signals, allowing you to create dynamic and evolving music that reflects the plant's interaction with its environment.

### Key Features:

- Plant Interaction: Biotron measures the plant's active resistance, capacitive resistance, and minimal inductive resistance to generate MIDI notes. The music changes in real-time as the plant's internal conditions, such as moisture and environmental factors, fluctuate.
- Theremin-Like Playability: In addition to responding to the plant's internal state, Biotron also reacts to movements around the plant, similar to a theremin. This feature allows you to "play" the plant by moving your hands nearby, influencing the music.
- Light Sensor Integration: Biotron includes a second MIDI channel connected to a light sensor. By adjusting light and shadows over the sensor, you can add another layer of musical interaction and depth to your compositions.
- Customizable Generative Logic: With the help of Playtronica's online tool, you can adjust and fine-tune Biotron’s generative music logic, tailoring the device to your creative needs and exploring various soundscapes.
- Versatile Connectivity: Biotron connects via USB and is compatible with DAWs on phones, computers, and hardware synthesizers, making it a flexible addition to any music production setup.

Biotron provides a unique fusion of nature and technology, turning the life processes of plants into a living, evolving musical experience. Ideal for musicians, sound artists, and nature enthusiasts, Biotron offers an innovative way to explore the intersection of biology and music.


### Built With

* [Raspberry Pi Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Build firmware file


1. Install docker, example for Ubuntu 20.04

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/manirko/biotron-firmware.git
   ```
3. Run the host safety suite
   ```sh
   ./tests/run_host_tests.sh
   ```
4. Configure/build with an explicit firmware version and the existing settings
   compatibility ID. See [`DEVELOPING.md`](DEVELOPING.md) for the exact command.

Do not use a timestamp as `FLASH_ID_STARTUP`: changing the settings identity
silently resets user presets.


### Load Firmware

For loading device you need firmware file. You can get it in different ways:
1) Build firmware by yourself. How to do it, you can read [here](#build-firmware-file)
2) Load firmware from [releases](https://github.com/Playtronica/biotron-firmware/releases/latest)
3) Use only a team-tested, version-aware Settings beta whose exact artifact is
recorded in the test manifest. Do not use an updater which selects `latest`
without validating the UF2 hash/version first.

After that you need to turn on boot mode on device:

1) A supported firmware can enter BOOT through the exact system SysEx described
in [`DEVELOPING.md`](DEVELOPING.md); the updater must download and validate the
artifact before sending BOOT.
2) Unknown/older firmware must follow the version-specific Help procedure.
Some old families cannot enter BOOT by MIDI; others reset stored settings.
Use physical BOOT contacts only with the revision-correct guide.

The device will be displayed as removable media (like a USB flash drive).
You should transfer the resulting .uf2 file to the removable media that appeared.
